##  Project Modules

### 1. Text Encoding & Decoding

* **Input**: User provides a message to encode.
* **Encoding Algorithms**: Choose from 3 different custom encoding algorithms.
* **Output**: Encoded text that hides the secret message.
* **Decoding**: User pastes the encoded text and selects the algorithm used to decode and retrieve the original message.

### 2. Image Encoding & Decoding (Base64)

* **Encoding**:

  * User uploads an image.
  * The image is converted to **Base64 format**, which can be stored, transmitted, or embedded.
* **Decoding**:

  * The Base64 string is decoded back into its original image format and displayed/downloaded.

##  Technologies Used

* **Frontend Only**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **No Backend, No Frameworks**
* **Runs fully in-browser**

##  How to Use

### Text Encoding

1. Enter your secret message.
2. Select one of the available encoding algorithms.
3. Click **Encode** to get the disguised message.

1. Paste the encoded message.(or also choose the .txt file)
2. Select the correct algorithm used for encoding.
3. Click **Decode** to retrieve the original message.

### Image Encoding

1. Upload an image (JPG/PNG).
2. The tool converts it into a Base64 string.
3. Copy or download the Base64 output.

### Image Decoding

1. Paste a valid Base64 string of an image.(or also choose the .txt file)
2. The tool renders the image and allows you to download it.
